# This script reformats all yaml translation files neatly.
# It exits with 1 if any files have been left.
# It is used in the pre-commit configuration of the project.

# The script handles all files sequentally, which is slow, but as the primary
# use case is via the pre-commit hook, which splits to N processes already
# we just keep this script stupid simple.

# One wart: if the filename contains "adventure" we don't strip any
# whitespace from the beginning or end. We could do this via an explicit flag
# but that would make the setup a bit more complex.

# Another wart: the order of yaml keys is hardcoded here,
# for example we want "title" to appear before "story" as titles typically come first.
# This is a bit nasty to maintain and ideally we parse the order from the
# json schema files but that was a lot of work...
